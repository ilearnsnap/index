<h1>ILEARNSNAP NOTES</h1>

<p> Dear learner, 
I should have simply typed out the questions and answers (as below) in the first place, so that this site is modifiable and ever growing. 
The short videos, voice overs, the logo marks etc. made things unmodifiable and allowed the ego to desperately cling to all these content.
Realizing this has been epic and comic at the same time, and changing for the better has been a relief.
As the story of Socrates teaches, it is never too late to learn and improve oneself. </p>
